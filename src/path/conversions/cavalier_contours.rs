//! Provides conversions to and from `cavalier_contours` path types.
//!
//! This module is intended to house `From` trait implementations that allow
//! for seamless interoperability between `path-offset`'s path representation
//! and the path types used by the `cavalier_contours` library.
// (Implementation pending)
